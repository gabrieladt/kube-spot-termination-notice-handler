Forked from https://github.com/mumoshu/kube-spot-termination-notice-handler

With some small changes like send cpu_usage function, that is used to pull Requested CPU and MEMORY from spot nodes and later, these metrics can be used by autoscalers.

With this, you are able to work "over provisioned", what is important for spot intance setup.

###
A Kubernetes DaemonSet to run 1 container per node to periodically polls the [EC2 Spot Instance Termination Notices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-spot-instance-termination-notices/) endpoint.
Once a termination notice is received, it will try to gracefully stop all the pods running on the Kubernetes node, up to 2 minutes before the EC2 Spot Instance backing the node is terminated.

## Installation

### Helm

A helm chart has been created for this tool, and at time of writing was in the `incubator` repository.

    $ helm install incubator/kube-spot-termination-notice-handler

## Available docker images/tags

Tags denotes Kubernetes/`kubectl` versions.
Using the same version for your Kubernetes cluster and spot-termination-notice-handler is recommended.
Note that the `-1` (or similar) is the revision of this tool, in case we need versioning.

* `egeland/spot-termination-notice-handler:1.6.8-1`
* `egeland/spot-termination-notice-handler:1.7.8-1`
* `egeland/spot-termination-notice-handler:1.8.1-1`

## Why use it

  * So that your kubernetes jobs backed by spot instances can keep running on another instances (typically on-demand instances)

## How it works

Each `spot-termination-notice-handler` pod polls the notice endpoint until it returns a http status `200`.
That status means a termination is scheduled for the EC2 spot instance running the handler pod, according to [my study](https://gist.github.com/mumoshu/f7f55e6e74aaf54f63d263326ca58ba3)).

Run `kubectl logs` against the handler pod to watch how it works.

```
$ kubectl logs --namespace kube-system spot-termination-notice-handler-ibyo6
This script polls the "EC2 Spot Instance Termination Notices" endpoint to gracefully stop and then reschedule all the pods running on this Kubernetes node, up to 2 minutes before the EC2 Spot Instance backing the node is terminated.
See https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/aws/new-ec2-spot-instance-termination-notices/ for more information.
`kubectl drain minikubevm` will be executed once a termination notice is made.

## Building against a specific version of Kubernetes

Run `KUBE_VERSION=<your desired k8s version> make build` to specify the version number of k8s/kubectl.

## Slack Notifications
Introduced in version 0.9.2 of this application (the @mumoshu version), you are able to setup a Slack incoming web hook in order to send slack notifications to a channel, notifying the users that an instance has been terminated.

Incoming WebHooks require that you set the SLACK_URL environmental variable as part of your PodSpec.

The URL should look something like: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T67UBFNHQ/B4Q7WQM52/1ctEoFjkjdjwsa22934

Slack Setup:
* Docs: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
* Setup: https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks


Show where things are happening by setting the `CLUSTER` environment variable to whatever you call your cluster.
Very handy if you have several clusters that report to the same Slack channel.

Example Pod Spec:

```
        env:
          - name: POD_NAME
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.name
          - name: NAMESPACE
            valueFrom:
              fieldRef:
                fieldPath: metadata.namespace
          - name: SLACK_URL
            value: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T67UBFNHQ/B4Q7WQM52/1ctEoFjkjdjwsa22934"
          - name: CLUSTER
            value: development
```
